# Algorithm Visualizer



## Overview

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various algorithms in action. It provides a clear and visual representation of how algorithms work, making it an educational tool for students, developers, and anyone interested in algorithms.

This project is built using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for creating interactive data visualizations.


## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- Support for graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Adjustable speed and step-by-step execution for a better learning experience.
- Randomized input generation to test algorithms with different data sets.
- Clear visualizations with animations for better understanding.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run Algorithm Visualizer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aashiparihar07/algorithm-visualizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd algorithm-visualizer
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage
Choose an algorithm from the menu.
Adjust the speed and input size if needed.
Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.
Step through the algorithm or let it run at full speed.
Enjoy learning and experimenting with different algorithms!
